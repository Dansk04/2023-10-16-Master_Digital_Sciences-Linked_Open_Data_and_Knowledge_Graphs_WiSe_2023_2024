## Introduction

* problem statement: How can we enrich knowledge graphs with additional information? 
* the property graph model is a subtype of the graph model and forms the underlying model of a graph database
* definition: Property graphs are a data structure for representing and analyzing relationships between entities. They consist of nodes representing entities and edges representing relationships between nodes.
* property graphs are a flexible and powerful method for data modeling
* they enable the representation of complex relationships between data points

## Structure of property graphs

* Nodes represent entities in a property graph
* each node can have different properties that are stored as key-value pairs
* for example, a node “person" can have the properties “name", “age", and “residence"
* Edges represent relationships between nodes
* can be directed or undirected and can also have properties
* for example, an edge “friendship" between two people can have the property “since" to store the time of the friendship

## Advantages and possible applications of property graphs

* flexibility in modeling complex data
* property graphs enable the modeling and storage of complex relationships between entities 
* they provide a flexible data structure that allows different types of entities and relationships to be represented and analyzed
* efficient queries and analysis of relationships
* property graphs enable efficient queries and analysis of relationships between entities
* by using GQL and Graph Algorithms, complex questions can be asked and answered over the graph to gain insights and patterns
* application examples in various industries
* property graphs find application in various industries such as social networks, recommender systems, knowledge graphs, and many more
* they are used to model and analyze connections between users, products, knowledge, and other entities to enable personalized recommendations, network analytics, and knowledge management

## Challenges and limitations of property graphs
* scalability
* property graphs can reach their limits when dealing with very large data sets
* performance can be impacted and it can be difficult to efficiently execute complex queries
* the query language for property graphs, can be complex and require some training
* it can be challenging to build the right query, especially for complex applications
* storage requirements
* property graphs can require a lot of storage due to their memory-intensive nature
* this can lead to increased costs, especially when large amounts of data need to be processed
